## Utah Stack.js: Node vs Deno DX
<small>(Utah Stack.js was formerly known as Utah Node.JS)</small>

I talked about my experience writing an app that need to render some html, handle a file upload of a .tar.gz archive, save that archive, extract and decompress, and then serve the files within. 

While working on this I discovered that I'm liking Deno more and more. Even if it has some really weird quirks.

## Utah Node.JS: Js on The Edge

My first ever presentation! I talked about "the edge", which is basically serverless with instant function start times. I was the 2nd presenter and I highly recommend watching the first one.
