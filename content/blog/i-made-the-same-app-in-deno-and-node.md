# I made the same app in Deno and Node
The app is for a little fantasy baseball Discord I'm in. We use a game called Out Of The Park Baseball to simulate and manage teams. Only one person actually runs the game (they're called the "comissioner") and they just stream the games. The game does have an official "online" mode but it requires everyone to have the game and its pretty clunky to set up. I noticed that the game can export a website in a `.tar.gz` file, so I decided to make something where the commissioner can upload the `.tar.gz` file and have the site be deployed somewhere.

Here's an outline of how the app works:

1. A server hosts static files and handles a `/upload` route
  1. For example, if you visit "https://my-not-real-site.app/" you'll see the landing page of the site.
2. the `/upload` route has a file input in a form to upload a .tar.gz file
3. The server saves the .tar.gz file to a `uploads/` directory
4. The server unzips and extracts the `.tar.gz` file's contents to some folder that the server is using to serve static files.
5. the `/upload` route uses basic authentication.

Currently the app is a Deno app running on a 512 MB instance on [fly.io](https://fly.io) for about $3/month. I suppose I could do a little more complicated deployment process and upload the extracted files to a CDN, or push them to a git repo thats connected to some static site provider. Maybe sometime in the future ðŸ˜‰

The Deno version of the app is using [Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev), so its server-side rendered and uses "Islands" with Preact.

The Node version of the app is using [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com), so it is also server-side rendered but fully hyrdates the ui with Vue. I never got the Nuxt app fully working, for some reason the Images on the site weren't being sent correctly but I didn't look much into it.

## JSX as a templating language

I'm not a big fan of JSX, but Deno made it painless to use. Part of that is because of Fresh and it already handles some setup and configuration headaches. I actually started to enjoy using it though!

I still hate all the weird `/// <reference />` comments though.

```typescript
/// <reference no-default-lib="true" />
/// <reference lib="dom" />
/// <reference lib="dom.iterable" />
/// <reference lib="dom.asynciterable" />
/// <reference lib="deno.ns" />
```

## Deno's std library is awesome

Deno's std library is awesome! I found it fairly intuitive to use. I was annoyed by a lot of stackoverflow results being out of date since Deno seems to have frequently deprecated or moved around some functionality. But I didn't bring in any dependencies besides what Fresh had.
I also appreciate that it uses the same APIs available in the browser.

Here's how I saved an uploaded file in Deno and Node

```typescript
//write to uploads/reports.tar.gz
const form = await req.formData();
const file = form.get("file") as File;
await ensureDir(Deno.cwd() + "/uploads");
const reader = readerFromStreamReader(file.stream().getReader());
const writer = await Deno.create(to);
await copy(reader, writer);
writer.close(); //While writing tests for Deno, it told me there was a leak here because I never closed writer. Cool!
```

And for node I was using Nuxt 3, which uses H3.

```typescript
const body = await readMultipartFormData(event); //util from H3 to parse formData
const file = body[0];
await rm(UPLOADS_PATH, { recursive: true, force: true });
await mkdir(UPLOADS_PATH);
await writeFile(`${UPLOADS_PATH}/report.tar.gz`, file.data);
```

## Deno Testing is slick

Deno's test runner is pretty easy to use and it'll even tell you when it detects memory leaks!

```typescript
Deno.test(
  "POST route",
  { permissions: { read: true, write: true } },
  async (t) => {
    t.name = "handle file save";
    const url = Deno.cwd() + "/test/data/test-dir.tar.gz";
    const res = await fileFetch(import.meta.resolve(url));
    const file = new File([await res.arrayBuffer()], "test-dir.tar.gz");
    const saveUrl = Deno.cwd() + "/test/data/test.tar.gz";
    await saveTar(file, saveUrl);
    await extractTar(saveUrl, Deno.cwd() + "/test/data/extracted");
    assert(await exists(saveUrl));
    await t.step("cleanup", async () => {
      await Deno.remove(saveUrl);
      await Deno.remove(Deno.cwd() + "/test/data/extracted", {
        recursive: true,
      });
    });
  }
);
```
## Deno is super easy to get started with 
no package.json, no npm packages, very little configuration. Just `deno run main.ts` and your app is running.


## Deno still has some work to do with package management

Package management is probably the most frustrating part of Deno. I was using Fresh, which encourages import_maps. I think this is ideal, but the tooling still auto-completes to importing urls. I had to manually update URLs to import_maps.

I also wasn't able to get deno to cache all dependencies during the docker image build so some unlucky soul will have to wait a few seconds when first visiting the app for Deno to download the rest of the dependencies.

## Deno uses roughly twice as much memory as Node
I deployed both apps to Fly.io and noticed that Deno, on average, was idiling at around 100MB of memory while the node app was at around 49MB. This is supposedly due to the typescript transpiler running in production. There doesn't seem to be a way to disable typescript in production, and I wasn't able to create a binary with `deno compile` (which does remove the transpiler) because of a bug.


## Deno had the smaller docker image size
Deno's image was about 120mb, while the node app was about 170mb
