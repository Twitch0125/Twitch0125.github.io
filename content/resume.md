## Skills

::floating-icon{icon="i-logos-javascript"}
### JavaScript
::

JavaScript will always have a special place in my heart ❤️.

Typescript however... well, it has a nice personality. If you want to know what I mean, I wrote about it [here](/blog/typescript)

### UI/UX Design

I'm a UX Nerd. I find coding a good UX that people actually enjoy using while
also solving business problems to be profoundly satisfying.

I first started learning UI (and later UX design) from Erik D Kennedy's
[Learn UI Design](https://www.learnui.design/) course.

## Libraries

::floating-icon{icon="i-logos-vue"}
### Vue
::

The most underrated JS framework. I'm not saying its the _best_, but it works
the best with my mental model.

::floating-icon{icon="i-logos-nuxt-icon"}
### Nuxt
::

Nuxt is also underrated. By far the best DX I've seen in a meta framework. The
team behind Nuxt have done a ton of work with Nuxt 3 to also improve the JS
ecosystem by creating a collection of universal js tools called
[unjs](https://unjs.io/). [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/) is especially cool.

::floating-icon{icon="i-logos-tailwindcss-icon"}
### Tailwind CSS
::

I've gotta mention Tailwind in today's job market, but I actually use
[UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev). UnoCSS is an engine you could use to make
TailwindCSS. I like it because its easy to integrate into anything, it's
**blazingly** fast, and its super easy to configure.

## Tools

::floating-icon{icon="i-logos-linux-tux"}
### Linux
::

I've been using Linux for longer than I knew how to program. Being familiar and
knowing how distros work has been a huge time saver at times. I also appreciate
the freedom of the OS and community.

I use Fedora BTW.

::floating-icon{icon="i-logos-docker-icon"}
### Docker
::

Docker and Docker compose are awesome tools for running apps and dev
environments. I actually prefer [Podman](https://podman.io) over docker since
its rootless by default and plays well with Docker. Not so much with Docker
Compose. But that's been less of an issue for me as I've gotten more experienced
with containers.

I wanna dive into Kubernetes (K8s) too. Podman can convert its pods into K8s
yaml which sounds super useful for enterprise dev environments.

::floating-icon{icon="i-logos-figma"}
### Figma
::

My preferred design tool! Since Figma is browser based I can use it on Linux
which is a huge benefit.

I've also started using [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) for extra lo-fi
mockups.
